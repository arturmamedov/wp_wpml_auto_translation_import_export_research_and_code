# WordPress Weglot to WPML Migration Repository

A comprehensive collection of automated solutions for migrating WordPress multilingual websites from Weglot to WPML, preserving SEO metadata and translation relationships.

## Problem Statement

Migrating from Weglot to WPML presents several technical challenges:

- **Weglot limitations**: No content export functionality without premium plans

- **Destination**: WPML-powered WordPress site  
- **Content Volume**: 60 WordPress posts
- **Languages**: Spanish (source) â†’ English, German, Italian, French
- **SEO Plugin**: Yoast SEO (metadata preservation required)
- **Total Output**: 300 posts (60 Ã— 5 languages)

## Solution Approaches

This repository contains three distinct migration methodologies, each with different technical requirements, costs, and complexity levels.

### 3. CSV Import Approach ðŸ’°/ðŸ†“

**Status**: Paid Plugin Recommended | Free Alternative Available | **Complexity**: Low-Medium | **Reliability**: High (paid) / Medium (free)

Structured CSV creation with WPML import metadata for systematic content migration.

**Architecture:**
- Spanish content extraction to CSV format
- AI translation with CSV-safe formatting
- WPML metadata column management
- Import via WP All Import Pro (recommended) or custom solution

**Required CSV Structure:**
```csv
post_title,post_content,_yoast_wpseo_title,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,_wpml_import_language_code,_wpml_import_source_language_code,_wpml_import_translation_group
```
