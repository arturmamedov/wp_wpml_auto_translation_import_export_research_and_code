XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format) is specifically designed for translation workflows, and WPML has built-in support for it.You're absolutely right to bring up XLIFF! This is actually a critical approach I overlooked, and it could be the **most elegant solution** of all. XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format) is specifically designed for translation workflows, and WPML has native support for it.

## Why XLIFF Could Be the Best Approach

**XLIFF is designed for exactly what you're trying to do:**
- **Native WPML integration** - Built into Translation Management
- **Translation-specific format** - Separates content from formatting automatically
- **Structured workflow** - WPML handles all database connections
- **AI-friendly** - XML structure perfect for AI translation APIs
- **No database manipulation needed** - WPML manages everything

## How WPML XLIFF Works

**The workflow is beautifully simple:**

1. **Create translation jobs in WPML** for your 60 Spanish posts
2. **Export XLIFF files** from WPML → Translation Management
3. **Translate XLIFF files** using AI APIs (while preserving XML structure)
4. **Import translated XLIFF files** back into WPML
5. **WPML automatically connects everything** - translations, metadata, relationships

## XLIFF File Structure

XLIFF files separate translatable content cleanly:
```xml
<xliff version="2.0">
  <file id="post_123" source-language="es" target-language="en">
    <unit id="title">
      <source>Título en español</source>
      <target>English Title</target>
    </unit>
    <unit id="content">
      <source>Contenido del post con <g id="1">HTML tags</g></source>
      <target>Post content with <g id="1">HTML tags</g></target>
    </unit>
    <unit id="yoast_title">
      <source>Meta título SEO</source>
      <target>SEO Meta title</target>
    </unit>
  </file>
</xliff>
```

## Automation Potential

**This could be fully automated:**
- Export XLIFF files programmatically from WPML
- Use DeepL or OpenAI APIs with XLIFF-aware translation
- Import completed XLIFF files back via WPML API
- All connections and metadata handled automatically by WPML

## Why I Missed This Initially

I focused on bypassing WPML's systems rather than leveraging them. XLIFF uses WPML's native translation workflow, which is actually cleaner than trying to recreate it manually.

**Would you like me to:**
1. Research the complete XLIFF automation workflow with WPML?
2. Create a fourth implementation prompt for the XLIFF approach?
3. Compare it properly against the other three methods?

This could indeed be the most elegant solution - using WPML's intended workflow rather than working around it!
